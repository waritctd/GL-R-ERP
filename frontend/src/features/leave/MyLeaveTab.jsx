 * than a loss (owner ruling, 2026-08-11: "the manual selection already shows each type's remaining
 * quota, so the collapsible is redundant"). It was only redundant once the select actually said so:
 * before this it listed bare type names, and comparing two types meant opening the disclosure or
 * cycling the select and re-reading the card each time. One open dropdown now answers "how much
 * do I have left, of each kind" in a single glance, and the card below stays the one detailed view.
 *
 * Rare types (MATERNITY/MILITARY/ORDINATION) deliberately get NO figure -- the same
 * everyday/rare split the balance card, the aggregate stat and the composer all apply, for the
 * same reason: their annualQuotaDays is either a sentinel (MILITARY's 366, V120) or a
 * per-occasion entitlement, so a "เหลือ N วัน" derived from it would be a number that means
 * nothing. See rareLeaveConditionText's comment above.
 *
 * Also falls back to the bare name while balances are still loading -- `balance` is simply absent
 * then, which is the same branch as a rare type.

 * if we show everything the page will just be over populated with cards") -- driven by whichever
 * leave type is currently picked in the "ดูโควตา" select above it (Panel's `actions`), so it
 * tracks a plain browsing control rather than a request-submission form (Phase A2, #485: the
 * submission form itself moved to the /leave/new composer -- this select's only job is choosing
 * which type's balance to preview). `loading` covers both "balances haven't loaded yet" and "no
 * acting employee resolved yet" (balancesQuery is disabled until then) so this never flashes a
 * bare `0` before real data lands; a resolved-but-missing balance (the selected type has no row)
 * gets its own EmptyState rather than silently rendering zeros.
 *
 * Phase A5 (#489/#493 convergence): the everyday headline used to be a bespoke `<strong>` number
 * with no visual proportion and no `role="progressbar"`. QuotaBar (promoted from the tax-allowance
 * form, already adopted by the /leave/new composer's step 3) replaces it. `used` is exactly what
 * the API already subtracts to produce `balance.remainingDays` (mockApi.js:
 * `remainingDays = annualQuotaDays - approvedDays - pendingDays`) -- the bar's empty portion IS
 * remainingDays, just shown as proportion instead of a lone digit, so this is a display change,
 * not an arithmetic one. `cap` is `isEveryday ? balance.annualQuotaDays : null` -- reusing the
 * same everyday/rare split this file already computes, rather than hand-rolling a fourth
 * MILITARY-sentinel check (the balance card, the composer, and the rules tab each already needed
 * one). QuotaBar itself renders nothing when `cap == null`, which is exactly the suppression rare
 * types need: MILITARY's annualQuotaDays (366) is a sentinel ("no annual ceiling; the paid cap is
 * the real rule", V120), and MATERNITY/ORDINATION are per-occasion entitlements, not a running
 * balance -- none of the three have a cap a progress bar could meaningfully fill toward. The
 * paid-cap headline + condition text that already existed for rare types renders unconditionally
 * alongside it, unchanged.

                (19.5rem) for the longest label a duration can produce -- measured, not guessed:
                at 18.5rem the 721px..1040px band left the widest option exactly one pixel short; `min-w-0` + `max-w-full` let it shrink inside the flex header rather than
                push the title, and `mobile:w-full` takes the stacked row above. */}

          holidays first (the shared calendar everyone is subject to), then this employee's own

          -- the pre-restructure layout put the filter above the holidays panel it had no effect

          Rebase note (#638): main's version of this file had just converted the INLINE filter bar
          here to FilterField. That inline bar no longer exists on either tab -- it is now the
          shared LeaveFilterBar below, which carries the FilterField conversion once instead of
